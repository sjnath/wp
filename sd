(A)	SELECTING ALL DATA
SELECT * FROM pet;
UPDATE pet SET birth = '1989-08-31' WHERE name = 'Bowser'
2.SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name = 'Bowser';
3.LECT * FROM pet WHERE birth >= '1998-1-1';

(B)	SELECTING PARTICULAR COLUMNS
SELECT name, birth FROM pet;
For example, to get birth dates for dogs and cats only, use this query:
mysql> SELECT name, species, birth FROM pet
-> WHERE species = 'dog' OR species = 'cat';

(C)	SORTING ROWS
SELECT name, birth FROM pet ORDER BY birth;
SELECT name, birth FROM pet ORDER BY birth DESC;
or example, to sort by type of animal in ascending order, then by birth date within animal type in descending order (youngest animals first), use the following query:
SELECT name, species, birth FROM pet
-> ORDER BY species, birth DESC;


(D)	WORKING WITH NULL VALUES
SELECT 1 IS NULL, 1 IS NOT NULL;


(E)	PATTERN MATCHING
SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name LIKE 'b%';
mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name LIKE '%fy';
mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name LIKE '%w%';

(F)	COUNTING ROWS
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pet;
SELECT owner, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY owner;
SELECT species, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY species;

(G)	USING MORE THAN ONE TABLE
mysql> SELECT pet.name,
-> TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR,birth,date) AS age,
-> remark
-> FROM pet INNER JOIN event
-> ON pet.name = event.name
-> WHERE event.type = 'litter';
